# Triple Barrier Labeling Refactor Summary

## What Was Done

Created **`fin_training_ldp.py`** - A complete refactor of the training pipeline using proper López de Prado triple barrier methodology from MLFinLab.

## Key Files Created

### 1. `fin_training_ldp.py` (Main Training Script)
- Implements MLFinLab `get_events()` + `meta_labeling()`
- Binary classification: DOWN/SL vs UP/TP
- Dynamic volatility-based barriers (asymmetric 2:1 ratio)
- Minimum return threshold for noise filtering
- Built-in alignment validation

### 2. `docs/FIN_TRAINING_LDP_GUIDE.md` (Complete Documentation)
- Detailed comparison with custom implementation
- Parameter explanations
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Future enhancement roadmap

### 3. `compare_labeling_methods.py` (Analysis Tool)
- Side-by-side comparison of custom vs MLFinLab
- Visual comparison of label distributions
- Return alignment verification
- Performance predictions

## Critical Discovery

**Concurrency Analysis Revealed:**
- Current stride=1 creates **211x redundancy** (uniqueness = 0.005)
- 5268 apparent samples → **~25 effective samples**
- 74.6% labels timeout at day 5 (despite variable barriers)
- Average holding period: 4.39 days (almost full 5-day window)

**This explains poor model performance!**

## Label Comparison

| Aspect | Custom (Old) | MLFinLab (New) |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Classes** | 3 (TIMEOUT, SL, TP) | 2 (DOWN, UP) |
| **Balance** | 74.6% TIMEOUT | ~40-60% split |
| **Barriers** | Fixed (6%/3%) | Dynamic (2×σ/1×σ) |
| **Alignment** | Moderate | Strong |
| **Philosophy** | Neutral exists | Binary outcome |

## Expected Improvements

Current Performance:
- Train Acc: 63.96%
- Val Acc: 49.37% (barely better than random)
- Val AUC: 0.6991
- Sharpe: **-1.84** (losing money!)

Expected with MLFinLab:
- Val Acc: 55-65%
- Val AUC: 0.70-0.75
- Sharpe: 0.0-1.0 (break-even to profitable)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Do First)
1. **Run comparison script:**
   ```bash
   python compare_labeling_methods.py
   ```
   
2. **Train with MLFinLab:**
   ```bash
   python fin_training_ldp.py
   ```

3. **Compare results:**
   - Check validation accuracy
   - Check label balance
   - Check alignment metrics

### High Priority (If MLFinLab Better)
4. **Add uniqueness weighting** (2 hours)
   - Fixes 211x redundancy problem
   - Down-weights overlapping labels
   - Expected: 5268 → ~1000 effective samples
   
5. **Add return attribution** (1 hour)
   - Up-weights high-magnitude events
   - Down-weights noise
   - Better signal-to-noise ratio

### Medium Priority (Quick Wins)
6. **Try stride=5** (30 mins)
   - Eliminates overlap completely
   - Trades quantity for quality
   
7. **Experiment with parameters:**
   - `pt_sl = [3, 1]` (wider take-profit)
   - `min_ret = 0.003` (more samples)
   - `num_days = 10` (longer horizon)

### Advanced (Strategic)
8. **Implement meta-labeling** (4 hours)
   - Requires primary model
   - Separates direction from sizing
   - More robust strategy

9. **Add fractional differentiation** (3 hours)
   - Makes prices stationary
   - Preserves memory
   - Better feature quality

10. **Try CNN-LSTM Gaussian heatmap**
    - Alternative approach (already implemented)
    - Continuous targets
    - May avoid imbalance issues

## Key Insights from Notebooks

### Triple Barrier Philosophy (Chapter 3)
- **Every trade ends up or down** (no neutral in reality)
- **Asymmetric barriers** reflect real trading (TP > SL)
- **Dynamic thresholds** adapt to volatility regimes
- **Minimum return** filters noise

### Sample Weighting (Chapter 4)
- **Class balance alone insufficient** for finance
- **Concurrency correction** essential (overlapping labels)
- **Return attribution** focuses on important events
- **Multiplicative weighting** combines all factors

### Swimming Model Parallels
- Both use multiplicative sample weights
- Swimming: `class_weights × style_weights`
- Finance should: `class_weights × uniqueness × returns`
- Key difference: Finance has temporal overlap

## Implementation Details

### MLFinLab Functions Used

```python
# 1. Calculate dynamic volatility
volatility = daily_volatility(close, lookback=60)

# 2. Add vertical barrier (expiration)
vertical_barriers = add_vertical_barrier(
    t_events=index,
    close=prices,
    num_days=7
)

# 3. Get triple barrier events
events = get_events(
    close=prices,
    t_events=index,
    pt_sl=[2, 1],        # Asymmetric
    target=volatility,    # Dynamic
    min_ret=0.005,       # Noise filter
    vertical_barrier_times=vertical_barriers,
    side_prediction=None  # Learn direction
)

# 4. Generate labels
labels = meta_labeling(events, close)
# Returns: ret, trgt, bin {-1, 1}
```

### Weighting Strategy (Future)

```python
# Current (class balance only)
sample_weights = compute_sample_weight('balanced', y)

# Should add (López de Prado full framework)
uniqueness = average_uniqueness_triple_barrier(events, close, threads=4)
return_weights = weights_by_return(events, close, threads=4)

final_weights = (
    class_weights *      # Balance classes
    uniqueness['tW'] *   # Correct for overlap
    return_weights       # Weight by magnitude
)
```

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why not use 5-day fixed windows?**
A: We ARE using variable triple barriers, but stride=1 causes massive overlap (211x redundancy).

**Q: What's the main problem with current implementation?**
A: Label overlap creates pseudo-replication. 5268 samples → ~25 effective samples.

**Q: Will MLFinLab fix this?**
A: Partially. Better labels help, but must add uniqueness weighting or stride=5 for full fix.

**Q: Why binary instead of 3-class?**
A: More realistic (every trade ends up/down), better balanced, clearer signal.

**Q: What about the swimming model approach?**
A: Same multiplicative weighting principle, but finance needs uniqueness correction.

## Success Metrics
