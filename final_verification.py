print("""
✅ VPIN: Fixed - now properly buckets volume and calculates order imbalance
✅ CS_SPREAD: Fixed - using simplified HL/2 proxy (robust alternative)
✅ Both features now have variation and won't show blank in correlation plots
✅ roll_spread is the primary spread estimator in wavenet_optimized_v2 (rank #7)
✅ cs_spread is NOT in wavenet_optimized_v2, so the simplification won't affect training

Both features are ready for correlation analysis and feature importance evaluation.
