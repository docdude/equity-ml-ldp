### Motivation

Hyper parameter tuning is an essential process in the machine learning algorithm adaptation stage. If this step is not done properly, the algorithm is likely to overfit, and the actual performance will be disappointing.
Machine learning literature pays special attention to cross validation for all tuned hyper parameters.
As we saw in Chapter 7, cross-validation in finance is a particularly difficult problem, and solutions used in other fields are prone to failure.
In Chapter 9, we learn how to tune Hyper parameters using the Purged K-Fold Cross Validation method.
