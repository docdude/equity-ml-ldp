## Labeling

### Motivation

In Chapter 2, we learned how to construct a financial characteristic matrix $X$ from an unstructured dataset. The unsupervised learning algorithm can learn patterns from the feature matrix $X$, for example, to determine whether it contains information about hierarchical clusters.

On the other hand, a supervised learning algorithm configures the rows of the feature matrix $X$ to be associated with an array of labels or values ​​$y$, so that these labels or values ​​can be predicted from the characteristics of the sample. 

In Chapter 3, we learn how to label using financial data.
