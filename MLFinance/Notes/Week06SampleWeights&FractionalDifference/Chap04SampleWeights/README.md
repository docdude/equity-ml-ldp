### Motivation
Chapter 3 introduced several techniques for labeling financial data. We introduced new concepts called Triple barrier methods and Meta Labeling, and explained how useful they are for various financial applications, including quantitative investment strategies.

In Chapter 4, we learn how to solve another problem that always exists in financial applications: the problem that observations are not generated from the IID distribution.

Most Machine Learning literature is based on the IID assumption, and one of the reasons why many machine learning applications fail in finance is because this assumption is unrealistic for financial time series.
