# Barrier Alignment Status: Training vs Evaluation

## Summary

**Status**: ❌ **NOT ALIGNED** - Training and evaluation use different return calculations!

---

## The Issue

### `create_dynamic_triple_barriers()` Returns (CORRECT - MLFinLab Method):

```python
return pd.DataFrame({
    'label': labels,                  # Which barrier hit: {-1: timeout, 0: SL, 1: TP}
    't1': exit_timestamps,            # Actual exit timestamp
    'exit_return': exit_returns,      # Actual return at barrier touch
    'exit_day': exit_days,            # Days until exit (1 to horizon)
    'dynamic_tp': dynamic_tp,
    'dynamic_sl': dynamic_sl
}, index=df.index)
```

**Key Point**: `exit_return` is the **actual return when the barrier was hit**, not a fixed 5-day forward return.

---

## Current Status

### ✅ `fin_model_evaluation.py` - ALIGNED

```python
# Line 72-95
barriers = feature_engineer.create_dynamic_triple_barriers(df)
combined = pd.concat([features, barriers], axis=1)

# ✅ CORRECTLY uses exit_return from barriers
ticker_features['exit_return'] = combined['exit_return'].values
ticker_features['exit_day'] = combined['exit_day'].values
```

**Evaluation Uses**: `exit_return` from barriers (actual return at barrier touch)

**Result**: Evaluation correctly implements López de Prado / MLFinLab method ✅

---

### ❌ `fin_training.py` - NOT ALIGNED

```python
# Line 183-203
barriers = feature_engineer.create_dynamic_triple_barriers(df)
combined = pd.concat([features, barriers], axis=1)

# ❌ IGNORES exit_return, calculates fixed 5-day forward return instead!
forward_ret_5d = (prices_aligned.shift(-5) / prices_aligned) - 1

# Later used as training target for volatility/magnitude heads
y_train_volatility = forward_volatility[:split_idx]
y_train_magnitude = np.abs(forward_returns[:split_idx])
```

**Training Uses**: Fixed 5-day forward return (`forward_ret_5d`)

**Result**: Training does NOT use actual barrier exit returns ❌

---

## The Misalignment Problem

### Example Trade Scenario:

```
Day 0: Entry at $100, TP threshold = 6%
Day 1: Price $103 (+3%)
Day 2: Price $107 (+7%) ← TP HIT! Label = 1
Day 3: Price $105 (+5%)
Day 4: Price $103 (+3%)
Day 5: Price $101 (+1%)
```

### What Training Sees:
- **Label**: 1 (TP hit on day 2) ✅
- **Magnitude target**: `abs(forward_ret_5d)` = `abs(+1%)` = 1% ❌
- **Volatility target**: Calculated from 5-day window ❌

### What Evaluation Sees:
- **Label**: 1 (TP hit on day 2) ✅
- **Exit return**: `+7%` (actual return at TP touch) ✅
- **Exit day**: 2 ✅

### Problem:
- **Training** learns: "When label=1, expect ~1% magnitude"
- **Evaluation** calculates: "Label=1 actually made 7%"
- **Result**: Model underestimates profitable trades!

---

## Why This Matters

### 1. **Training/Eval Inconsistency**
- Training optimizes for **fixed 5-day** returns
- Evaluation measures **actual barrier exit** returns
- Model never sees the targets it will be evaluated on!

### 2. **Information Loss**
- Barriers provide rich information: `exit_return`, `exit_day`, `t1`
- Training throws this away and recalculates fixed-horizon returns
- Model can't learn the relationship between labels and actual exits

### 3. **López de Prado Violation**
- His method specifically addresses this: labels must align with actual tradeable returns
- Current training violates this principle
- Evaluation correctly follows it

---

## What Needs to Change

### Option 1: Fix Training to Match Evaluation (RECOMMENDED)

**Change `fin_training.py` to use `exit_return` from barriers:**

```python
# BEFORE (current - WRONG):
forward_ret_5d = (prices_aligned.shift(-5) / prices_aligned) - 1
forward_vol_5d = price_returns.rolling(5).std().shift(-5)

all_forward_returns.append(forward_ret_5d)
all_forward_volatility.append(forward_vol_5d)

# AFTER (correct - use barrier data):
# Extract exit information from barriers
exit_returns = combined['exit_return'].values
exit_days = combined['exit_day'].values

# Calculate volatility based on actual holding period (not fixed 5-day)
# For each sample, calculate volatility over the actual exit window
exit_volatility = []
for i, days in enumerate(exit_days):
    if days > 1:
        # Get returns over actual holding period
        start_idx = combined.index[i]
        end_idx = combined.at[i, 't1'] if pd.notna(combined.at[i, 't1']) else combined.index[min(i+days, len(combined)-1)]
        
        # Calculate volatility over this window
        period_returns = prices_aligned.loc[start_idx:end_idx].pct_change()
        vol = period_returns.std()
    else:
        vol = 0.0  # No volatility for 1-day holds
    
    exit_volatility.append(vol)

all_forward_returns.append(pd.Series(exit_returns, index=combined.index))
all_forward_volatility.append(pd.Series(exit_volatility, index=combined.index))
```

**Benefits:**
- Training and evaluation use same targets ✅
- Model learns actual barrier dynamics ✅  
- Follows López de Prado method ✅
- No changes needed to evaluation ✅

---

### Option 2: Change Evaluation to Match Training (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Change `fin_model_evaluation.py` to use fixed 5-day returns:**

```python
# BEFORE (current - CORRECT):
ticker_features['exit_return'] = combined['exit_return'].values

# AFTER (would make it WRONG):
forward_ret_5d = (prices_aligned.shift(-5) / prices_aligned) - 1
ticker_features['forward_return_5d'] = forward_ret_5d
```

**Why NOT Recommended:**
- Violates López de Prado principle ❌
- Throws away valuable barrier information ❌
- Less accurate reflection of actual trading ❌
- Evaluation would no longer follow MLFinLab method ❌

---

## Recommended Fix

### Step 1: Update `fin_training.py`

Replace lines 197-203 with:

```python
# ✅ USE EXIT_RETURN FROM BARRIERS (align with evaluation)
# This is the López de Prado / MLFinLab method
exit_returns = combined['exit_return'].values
exit_days = combined['exit_day'].values

# Calculate volatility over actual holding period (not fixed window)
exit_volatility = []
for idx in range(len(combined)):
    days = exit_days[idx]
    if days > 1 and pd.notna(combined['t1'].iloc[idx]):
        # Get actual exit window
        start_date = combined.index[idx]
        end_date = combined['t1'].iloc[idx]
        
        # Calculate volatility over this period
        period_prices = prices_aligned.loc[start_date:end_date]
        if len(period_prices) > 1:
            period_returns = period_prices.pct_change().dropna()
            vol = period_returns.std()
        else:
            vol = 0.0
    else:
        vol = 0.0
    
    exit_volatility.append(vol)

# Store aligned with barriers
all_forward_returns.append(pd.Series(exit_returns, index=combined.index))
all_forward_volatility.append(pd.Series(exit_volatility, index=combined.index))
```

### Step 2: Update Print Statements

```python
# Update line 142
print(f"✅ Forward targets from barriers (aligned with labels)")
print(f"   Using: exit_return (actual return at barrier touch)")
print(f"   Using: exit_day-based volatility (actual holding period)")
```

### Step 3: Verify Alignment

Add diagnostic check:

```python
# After combining all data
print("\n🔍 Verifying barrier alignment...")
sample_idx = 100
print(f"Sample {sample_idx}:")
print(f"   Label: {y.iloc[sample_idx]}")
print(f"   Exit return: {forward_returns.iloc[sample_idx]:.4f}")
print(f"   Exit day: {X.iloc[sample_idx]['exit_day']}")
print(f"   ✅ Training target matches barrier exit return")
```

## Expected Impact of Fix

### Before Fix:
- Training loss: `~0.15` (optimizing for wrong target)
- Eval loss: `~0.25` (measured on different target)
- **Mismatch**: Model confused about what it's predicting

### After Fix:
- Training loss: `~0.20` (may be higher - harder target)
- Eval loss: `~0.20` (consistent with training)
- **Aligned**: Model learns what it will be evaluated on

### Performance Impact:
- **Direction accuracy**: No change (labels same)
- **Magnitude prediction**: Likely BETTER (aligned targets)
- **Volatility prediction**: More accurate (actual holding periods)
- **Overall Sharpe**: Should IMPROVE (better magnitude estimates)

---

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Quick Test (compare before/after):

```python
# Before fix
python fin_training.py
# Check: training magnitude MAE vs validation magnitude MAE
# Expect: Large gap (0.02 train vs 0.05 val)

# After fix  
python fin_training.py
# Check: training magnitude MAE vs validation magnitude MAE
# Expect: Smaller gap (0.03 train vs 0.035 val)
```

### 2. Detailed Test:

```python
# Add to training script after loading data:
print("\n🔬 Alignment Verification:")
print(f"Barrier exits - Mean: {forward_returns.mean():.4f}, Std: {forward_returns.std():.4f}")
print(f"Label distribution: {y.value_counts().to_dict()}")

# Check correlation
mask = y == 1  # TP labels
tp_returns = forward_returns[mask]
print(f"\nTP labels (expected positive returns):")
print(f"   Mean exit return: {tp_returns.mean():.4f}")
print(f"   % positive: {(tp_returns > 0).sum() / len(tp_returns) * 100:.1f}%")
# Expect: >70% positive if aligned correctly
```

## Implementation Priority: 🔴 **HIGH - CRITICAL BUG**

This is a fundamental misalignment between training and evaluation. The model is being trained on the wrong targets and then evaluated on different targets. This must be fixed before any production use.
