# test_pbo_quick.py Alignment Fix
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Now aligned with training/evaluation

---

## 🚨 Issue Found

`test_pbo_quick.py` was using **FIXED 5-day forward returns** instead of **exit_return from barriers**.

---

## ❌ Before (MISALIGNED)

```python
# Line 66-68 - OLD METHOD
forward_ret_5d = (prices_aligned['close'].shift(-5) / prices_aligned['close']) - 1
forward_ret_5d = forward_ret_5d.fillna(0)
ticker_features['forward_return_5d'] = forward_ret_5d.values

# Line 104 - Using wrong returns
model_feature_cols = [col for col in X.columns 
                      if col not in ['ticker', 'forward_return_5d']]

# Line 149-151 - Getting wrong returns
forward_returns_all = X['forward_return_5d'].values
```

**Problem**: PBO analysis was using fixed 5-day returns, but the model was trained on barrier exit returns!

---

## ✅ After (ALIGNED)

```python
# Lines 63-67 - NEW METHOD (aligned with barriers)
# ✅ USE EXIT_RETURN FROM BARRIERS (López de Prado / MLFinLab method)
# This is the actual return at barrier touch, NOT fixed 5-day returns
ticker_features['exit_return'] = combined['exit_return'].values
ticker_features['exit_day'] = combined['exit_day'].values
ticker_features['ticker'] = ticker

# Line 104 - Exclude correct columns
model_feature_cols = [col for col in X.columns 
                      if col not in ['ticker', 'exit_return', 'exit_day']]

# Lines 148-152 - Use barrier exit returns
# ✅ USE EXIT_RETURN FROM BARRIERS (aligned with training/evaluation)
exit_returns_all = X['exit_return'].values
val_start_idx = val_split + seq_len
forward_returns = exit_returns_all[val_start_idx:val_start_idx + len(X_val)]
```

**Fixed**: PBO now analyzes strategies using the same returns the model was trained on!

---

## 🎯 Alignment Status

### All Scripts Now Aligned ✅

| Script | Barrier Creation | Return Calculation | Status |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| `fin_training.py` | ✅ `create_dynamic_triple_barriers()` | ✅ `exit_return` | ✅ Aligned |
| `fin_model_evaluation.py` | ✅ `create_dynamic_triple_barriers()` | ✅ `exit_return` | ✅ Aligned |
| `test_pbo_quick.py` | ✅ `create_dynamic_triple_barriers()` | ✅ `exit_return` | ✅ **NOW FIXED** |

---

## 🔍 Why This Matters

### The Problem
If PBO uses different returns than training:
- **Training**: Learns from barrier exit returns (1-10 days, variable)
- **PBO test**: Tests with fixed 5-day returns
- **Result**: PBO score meaningless - testing different strategy!

### The Fix
Now all three scripts use:
- Same barrier labeling
- Same return calculation at barrier touch
- Same time horizons (dynamic, not fixed)

**Result**: PBO now correctly measures overfitting risk of the actual trading strategy!

---

## 📊 Expected Impact

**Before fix**:
- PBO might show low/high overfitting
- But not actually testing the model's strategy
- Meaningless validation

**After fix**:
- PBO correctly tests model's actual strategy
- Returns align with labels
- Meaningful overfitting assessment

---

## 🧪 Validation

To verify alignment, check when running `test_pbo_quick.py`:

```python
print(f"   Forward returns mean: {forward_returns.mean():.6f}")
print(f"   Forward returns std: {forward_returns.std():.6f}")
```

**Expected**:
- Mean should be close to what training saw
- Std should match barrier exit returns
- Not exactly ±X% at fixed 5-day horizon

---

## 📋 Summary of Changes

1. **Line 63-67**: Use `exit_return` from barriers (not `forward_ret_5d`)
2. **Line 66**: Add `exit_day` for analysis
3. **Line 104**: Exclude `exit_return` and `exit_day` from model features
4. **Line 148-152**: Use `exit_returns_all` from barriers

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] `test_pbo_quick.py` uses `create_dynamic_triple_barriers()`
- [x] Uses `exit_return` from barriers (not fixed 5-day)
- [x] Excludes `exit_return` from model input features
- [x] Strategy returns calculated with barrier exit returns
- [x] Aligned with `fin_training.py`
- [x] Aligned with `fin_model_evaluation.py`

---

**Status**: ✅ All scripts now properly aligned with López de Prado / MLFinLab methodology

**Next**: Run PBO test with corrected alignment to get meaningful overfitting assessment
