## 📊 Methodology Summary

This feature selection follows **López de Prado's "Advances in Financial Machine Learning"**:

### Feature Importance (Chapter 8)
- **MDI**: Mean Decrease Impurity (in-sample)
- **MDA**: Mean Decrease Accuracy (out-of-sample) ← Most important
- **SFI**: Single Feature Importance (standalone)
- **Orthogonal**: PCA-based redundancy removal

### Cross-Validation (Chapter 11)
- **Purged K-Fold**: Prevents time-series leakage
- **Embargo Period**: 2% buffer between splits
- **Walk-Forward**: 1,242 periods rolling validation

### Overfitting Detection (Chapter 11)
- **PBO**: Probability of Backtest Overfitting
- **CPCV**: Combinatorial Purged CV
- **Performance Degradation**: In-sample vs OOS
