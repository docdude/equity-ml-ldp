# Feature Selection Session Summary
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Duration**: Complete López de Prado evaluation  
**Outcome**: ✅ 18 optimized features selected from 109 comprehensive set

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### 1. Comprehensive Feature Evaluation ✅
Ran complete López de Prado methodology on 109 features:
- **MDI (Mean Decrease Impurity)**: In-sample tree-based importance
- **MDA (Mean Decrease Accuracy)**: Out-of-sample permutation importance
- **SFI (Single Feature Importance)**: Standalone feature performance
- **Orthogonal Analysis**: PCA-based redundancy detection
- **PBO (Probability of Backtest Overfitting)**: Robustness validation
- **Walk-Forward Analysis**: 1,242 periods of rolling validation

### 2. Feature Selection Completed ✅
Reduced from **109 → 18 features** (83.5% reduction):
- Selected based on combined MDI/MDA/SFI/Orthogonal rankings
- Removed redundant features (63% PCA compression detected)
- Kept only features with strong out-of-sample performance
- All top features from most recent timestep (t19)

### 3. Configuration Updated ✅
Created new preset in `feature_config.py`:
```python
config = FeatureConfig.get_preset('wavenet_optimized')
# Returns 18 carefully selected features
```

### 4. Documentation Created ✅
Generated comprehensive documentation:
- `WAVENET_FEATURE_SELECTION_RESULTS.md` - Full analysis (detailed)
- `FEATURE_SELECTION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation guide
- `FEATURE_SELECTION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick lookup card
- Updated `feature_config.py` with `wavenet_optimized` preset

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Train WaveNet with 18 features**
   ```python
   config = FeatureConfig.get_preset('wavenet_optimized')
   # Input shape: (batch, 20_timesteps, 18_features)
   ```

2. **Run López de Prado evaluation on trained WaveNet**
   ```python
   evaluator = LopezDePradoEvaluator(embargo_pct=0.02, n_splits=5)
   results = evaluator.comprehensive_evaluation(X, y, wavenet_model)
   ```

3. **Compare against RandomForest baseline**
   - Target: Purged CV AUC ≥ 0.67
   - Target: PBO < 0.30

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
4. **Implement attention mechanism**
   - Focus on recent timesteps (t19 is critical)
   - Consider exponential decay for older observations

5. **Add feature importance monitoring**
   - Track MDI/MDA during training
   - Detect feature drift in production

6. **Create ensemble**
   - Combine WaveNet + RandomForest
   - Use feature importance for voting weights

### Medium-term (Next Month)
7. **Implement regime-based switching**
   - High volatility regime → emphasize vol features
   - Low volatility regime → emphasize momentum features

8. **Set up production monitoring**
   - Feature drift detection
   - Performance degradation alerts
   - Model retraining triggers

## 🎓 Methodology Summary

This analysis follows **López de Prado's best practices**:

### Feature Importance (Chapter 8)
✅ **MDI**: Mean Decrease Impurity (in-sample, tree-based)  
✅ **MDA**: Mean Decrease Accuracy (out-of-sample, robust)  
✅ **SFI**: Single Feature Importance (no substitution effects)  
✅ **Orthogonal**: PCA-based redundancy removal  

### Cross-Validation (Chapter 11)
✅ **Purged K-Fold**: Removes train/test leakage in time-series  
✅ **Embargo Period**: 2% buffer between splits  
✅ **Walk-Forward**: Rolling window validation (1,242 periods)  

### Overfitting Detection (Chapter 11)
✅ **PBO**: Probability of Backtest Overfitting (via pypbo)  
✅ **CPCV**: Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation  
✅ **Performance Degradation**: In-sample vs out-of-sample comparison

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### 1. Walk-Forward Variability
**High std deviation**: ±0.1759 indicates regime sensitivity
- Model performance varies significantly across time
- Some periods: AUC = 1.000 (perfect)
- Other periods: AUC = 0.000 (random)

**Mitigation**:
- Use ensemble methods
- Implement regime detection
- Conservative position sizing
- Dynamic stop-losses

### 2. Out-of-Sample Losses
**Prob(OOS Loss) = 87.1%** despite low PBO
- High chance of losses in production
- Even robust models lose sometimes

**Mitigation**:
- Position sizing: max 1-2% per trade
- Portfolio diversification
- Drawdown limits
- Regular retraining

### 3. Feature Drift
**Features can change over time**
- Market regimes shift
- Correlations break down
- New patterns emerge

**Monitoring**:
- Track MDI/MDA monthly
- Alert if feature importance shifts >20%
- Retrain when PBO > 0.30
- Validate Walk-Forward AUC quarterly
