# Should test_pbo.py Use Real Data?

**Question**: Would refactoring `test_pbo.py` to use real data help us evaluate models better?

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Current State**: test_pbo.py uses synthetic data for unit testing  
**Alternative Scripts**: test_pbo_quick.py and fin_model_evaluation.py already use real data

---

## TL;DR

**❌ NO - Don't refactor test_pbo.py to use real data**

**Why**: We already have `test_pbo_quick.py` and `fin_model_evaluation.py` for real data evaluation. Keep `test_pbo.py` as a fast unit test suite.

---

## Current Script Purposes

### test_pbo.py (Synthetic Data)
```python
# Purpose: Unit tests for PBO implementation
# Data: Synthetic returns (random, controlled)
# Speed: Fast (< 5 seconds)
# Use: Verify PBO calculation works correctly
```

### test_pbo_quick.py (Real Data)
```python
# Purpose: Quick validation of trained Keras models
# Data: Real model predictions + real forward returns
# Speed: Moderate (~1-2 minutes for feature engineering)
# Use: Validate Keras model after training
```

### fin_model_evaluation.py (Real Data)
```python
# Purpose: Comprehensive evaluation (sklearn or Keras)
# Data: Real features + real returns
# Speed: Fast for Keras PBO, slow for sklearn full suite
# Use: Feature testing (sklearn) or comprehensive Keras evaluation
```

---

## What test_pbo.py Currently Does (and Why It's Good)

### 1. Verifies PBO Implementation
```python
# Test 1: Basic - Mixed strategies
# Ensures PBO can handle typical strategy returns
test_pbo_basic()  # → PBO should be reasonable (0.3-0.7)

# Test 2: Overfit - Random walks
# Verifies PBO detects overfitting
test_pbo_overfit()  # → PBO should be high (> 0.5)

# Test 3: Robust - Consistent positive drift
# Verifies PBO recognizes robust strategies
test_pbo_robust()  # → PBO should be low (< 0.3)
```

**Value**: These are **controlled experiments** that prove PBO works as expected.

### 2. Tests Edge Cases
```python
# Test 4: List input (not just numpy arrays)
test_pbo_from_list()  # → Handles different input formats

# Test 5: Single strategy (edge case)
test_pbo_single_strategy()  # → Returns N/A (correct behavior)
```

**Value**: Ensures robustness against API misuse.

### 3. Fast Feedback Loop
```python
# Run all tests in < 5 seconds
python test_pbo.py

# Useful when:
# - Modifying PBO implementation
# - Testing pypbo integration
# - Debugging CSCV logic
# - Onboarding new developers
```

**Value**: Quick verification without waiting for data loading.

## What Would We Gain by Adding Real Data?

### Option A: Replace Synthetic with Real Data

```python
# Current (synthetic):
def test_pbo_basic():
    returns = np.random.normal(0.001, 0.02, 252)  # Fast
    
# Proposed (real data):
def test_pbo_basic():
    # Load model
    model = load_model('best_model.keras')  # 2-3 seconds
    
    # Load data
    df = load_and_engineer_features(tickers)  # 30-60 seconds
    
    # Generate predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_val)  # 5-10 seconds
    
    # Create strategies
    strategy_returns = create_strategies(predictions)  # 1 second
    
    # Run PBO
    pbo_result = pbo_func(strategy_returns)  # 5-10 seconds
```

**Gained**:
- ❓ Nothing - this is exactly what `test_pbo_quick.py` already does!

**Lost**:
- ❌ Speed (5s → 60s)
- ❌ Simplicity (controlled tests → complex dependencies)
- ❌ Isolation (unit test → integration test)

**Verdict**: ❌ **BAD IDEA** - duplicates test_pbo_quick.py

---

### Option B: Add Real Data Tests (Keep Synthetic)

```python
# Keep existing synthetic tests
def test_pbo_basic():
    """Unit test with synthetic data"""
    pass

# Add new real data tests
def test_pbo_real_keras_model():
    """Integration test with real Keras model"""
    model = load_model('best_model.keras')
    # ... same as test_pbo_quick.py

def test_pbo_real_sklearn_model():
    """Integration test with real sklearn model"""
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    # ... same as fin_model_evaluation.py
```

**Gained**:
- ✅ Integrated test suite (unit + integration)
- ✅ Single entry point for testing

**Lost**:
- ❌ Still duplicates test_pbo_quick.py and fin_model_evaluation.py
- ❌ Slower (can't run quick unit tests only)
- ❌ More complex (now needs data files, models, etc.)

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **MARGINAL** - slight benefit but adds complexity

---

### Option C: Add Real Data Regression Tests

```python
# Keep existing tests, add regression tests
def test_pbo_regression():
    """Regression test: Ensure PBO results stay consistent"""
    
    # Load saved predictions from previous run
    previous_predictions = pd.read_csv('artifacts/test_predictions.csv')
    
    # Generate new predictions with same model
    model = load_model('best_model.keras')
    new_predictions = model.predict(X_val)
    
    # Check PBO is similar
    old_pbo = calculate_pbo(previous_predictions)
    new_pbo = calculate_pbo(new_predictions)
    
    assert abs(old_pbo - new_pbo) < 0.05, "PBO changed significantly!"
    print(f"✅ PBO regression test passed: {old_pbo:.3f} → {new_pbo:.3f}")
```

**Gained**:
- ✅ Detects if code changes affect PBO results
- ✅ Catches regressions in model predictions
- ✅ Validates consistency across refactors

**Lost**:
- ❌ Requires saved artifacts
- ❌ Can break when model is retrained (expected)
- ❌ Need to manage test fixtures

**Verdict**: ✅ **GOOD** - but better as separate `test_regression.py`

**Conclusion**: We already have real data PBO evaluation!

### Already Covered by fin_model_evaluation.py ✅

```python
from fin_model_evaluation import main
main(model=None)  # sklearn with real data
main(model=keras_model)  # keras with real data
```

**Provides**:
- ✅ Real data evaluation for sklearn (full suite)
- ✅ Real data evaluation for Keras (PBO only)
- ✅ Feature importance (sklearn)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation

## The Actual Value of test_pbo.py (As Is)

### 1. Development/Debugging Tool

When modifying PBO implementation:

```python
# Modify lopez_de_prado_evaluation.py
def probability_backtest_overfitting(...):
    # Change CSCV logic
    # Fix bug
    # Optimize performance
    pass

# Quick verification (< 5 seconds)
python test_pbo.py

# Expected output:
# Test 1 (Basic): PBO = 0.45 ✓
# Test 2 (Overfit): PBO = 0.68 ✓ (high as expected)
# Test 3 (Robust): PBO = 0.23 ✓ (low as expected)
# All tests passed!
```

**Without synthetic tests**: Would need to wait 60+ seconds to load real data every time.

### 2. Educational Tool

For understanding PBO:

```python
# "What does PBO mean?"
# → Run test_pbo.py, see synthetic examples

# "Why is high PBO bad?"
# → Look at test_pbo_overfit() - pure random walks

# "What's a good PBO?"
# → Look at test_pbo_robust() - consistent strategies
```

**Value**: Synthetic data is **easier to understand** than real complex data.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Unit tests (fast)
        run: python test_pbo.py  # < 5 seconds
      
      # Don't run expensive integration tests on every commit
      # - name: Integration tests (slow)
      #   run: python test_pbo_quick.py  # 60+ seconds
```

**Value**: Fast unit tests can run on every commit. Integration tests run less frequently.

## Alternative: What We SHOULD Add

Instead of refactoring `test_pbo.py`, consider these additions:

### 1. test_regression.py (New Script)

```python
"""
Regression tests for model predictions and PBO results
"""

def test_model_predictions_stable():
    """Ensure model predictions haven't changed unexpectedly"""
    # Load reference predictions
    ref_preds = pd.read_csv('artifacts/reference_predictions.csv')
    
    # Generate new predictions
    model = load_model('best_model.keras')
    new_preds = model.predict(X_val)
    
    # Check similarity
    correlation = np.corrcoef(ref_preds, new_preds)[0, 1]
    assert correlation > 0.95, f"Predictions changed! Correlation: {correlation:.3f}"

def test_pbo_stable():
    """Ensure PBO results are consistent"""
    # Load reference PBO
    ref_pbo = json.load('artifacts/reference_pbo.json')
    
    # Calculate new PBO
    new_pbo = run_pbo_analysis()
    
    # Check consistency
    assert abs(ref_pbo['pbo'] - new_pbo['pbo']) < 0.05

def test_strategy_returns_stable():
    """Ensure strategy construction hasn't changed"""
    # Regression test for strategy logic
    pass
```

**Purpose**: Catch unintended changes from refactoring.

### 2. Expand test_pbo.py with More Synthetic Scenarios

```python
def test_pbo_with_autocorrelation():
    """Test PBO with autocorrelated returns (realistic)"""
    # Create returns with AR(1) structure
    pass

def test_pbo_with_regime_change():
    """Test PBO when strategies work in period 1 but fail in period 2"""
    # Simulate regime change
    pass

def test_pbo_with_fat_tails():
    """Test PBO with heavy-tailed returns (like real markets)"""
    # Use Student's t-distribution
    pass

def test_pbo_with_correlation():
    """Test PBO when strategies are correlated"""
    # Create correlated strategy returns
    pass
```

**Purpose**: Test PBO under different market conditions (still synthetic, still fast).

### 3. Notebook: PBO Deep Dive

```python
# notebooks/pbo_deep_dive.ipynb

# Cell 1: Synthetic examples (from test_pbo.py)
# Cell 2: Real data example (from test_pbo_quick.py)
# Cell 3: Visualizations (histograms, rank plots)
# Cell 4: Sensitivity analysis (vary n_splits, embargo_pct)
# Cell 5: Comparison with other metrics
```

**Purpose**: Educational resource combining synthetic and real examples.

2. **Current synthetic tests are valuable**:
   - Fast (< 5 seconds)
   - Controlled experiments
   - Easy to understand
   - Good for development/debugging

3. **Would duplicate existing functionality**:
   - No new capabilities gained
   - More complexity
   - Slower test suite

4. **Better alternatives exist**:
   - Add `test_regression.py` for stability checks
   - Expand synthetic scenarios in `test_pbo.py`
   - Create educational notebook

### ✅ What You SHOULD Do Instead

1. **Keep test_pbo.py as-is** (fast unit tests)
2. **Use test_pbo_quick.py** for quick Keras validation
3. **Use fin_model_evaluation.py** for comprehensive analysis
4. **Consider adding**:
   - `test_regression.py` for stability/regression testing
   - More synthetic scenarios to `test_pbo.py` (autocorrelation, regime changes, etc.)
   - Educational notebook combining synthetic and real examples

Proposed Additions:
├── test_regression.py       # Regression tests (real) - NEW
├── notebooks/
│   └── pbo_deep_dive.ipynb  # Educational resource - NEW
└── test_pbo.py              # Add more synthetic scenarios - EXPAND
```

**This structure**:
- ✅ Separates concerns (unit vs integration vs regression)
- ✅ Optimizes for speed where needed (unit tests)
- ✅ Provides comprehensive coverage (integration tests)
- ✅ Enables learning (educational resources)
- ✅ Avoids duplication

---

## Bottom Line

**You already have everything you need for real data evaluation**:
- `test_pbo_quick.py` → Quick Keras PBO validation ✅
- `fin_model_evaluation.py` → Comprehensive evaluation (sklearn or Keras) ✅

**test_pbo.py serves a different, valuable purpose**:
